# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a **movie recommendation system** that predicts the best movie for a user based on their genre preferences and ratings. It uses a **neural network model** trained on the MovieLens dataset.

## Features
- Loads and processes **MovieLens dataset** (movies and ratings)
- **One-hot encodes** movie genres for feature extraction
- **Creates user profiles** based on their rating history
- **Trains a neural network** to predict user preferences
- **Recommends movies** based on the highest predicted rating

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure the dataset files `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv` are in the same directory.
2. Run the script to train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Get movie recommendations:
   ```python
   from recommend import recommend_movie
   recommended_movie = recommend_movie(model, user_data, movies_scaled, movies_original)
   print(recommended_movie)
   ```
